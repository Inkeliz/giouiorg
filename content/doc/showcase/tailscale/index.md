This is an open source Tailscale Android client. Tailscale is a mesh VPN
alternative that makes it easy to connect your devices, wherever they are. No
more fighting configuration or firewall ports. Built on WireGuardÂ®, Tailscale
enables an incremental shift to zero-trust networking by
implementing "always-on" remote access. This guarantees a consistent, portable,
and secure experience independent of physical location.
