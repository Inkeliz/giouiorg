## General Discussion

For general discussion there is a [**mailing list**](https://lists.sr.ht/~eliasnaur/gio).
It is used for general Gio announcements and questions.

### Reporting Issues

Bugs or feature requests can be submitted through the
[**issue tracker**](https://todo.sr.ht/~eliasnaur/gio) or send an email
to [~eliasnaur/gio@todo.sr.ht](mailto:~eliasnaur/gio@todo.sr.ht).

## Slack

An active group of people are in [**Gophers Slack**](https://invite.slack.golangbridge.org/)
in [`#gioui`](https://gophers.slack.com/archives/CM87SNCGM) channel.

It's a good place to interactively discuss different topics.

## Online Meetup

Once in a month, or so, there is a community call with different
topics. Usually there is an update to the project, a talk by someone
from the community and discussions of different problems that people
are facing. The events are announced on the
[mailing list](https://lists.sr.ht/~eliasnaur/gio).

You can find recordings of the previous events on [**Youtube**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzuKUnKK5gAFJKNyA1imIHw).
